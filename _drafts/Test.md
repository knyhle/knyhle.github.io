For the past week I've recently changed my keyboard to Dvorak. Have been typing at 5 wpm. Really slow. Like rewiring your brain.
Pretty fun though. Even if the feels weird now.

Helix editor looks pretty cool. But something about rust and The Foundation and their trademarks?

Potentially Learning Go right now.
Saw something about Protobufs, gRPC and realized I need to use it.

Spent the entire day learning about python package managers.
Started with pipenv, but that didn't feel vey fast so I decided to go with poetry. Mix pipx with poetry.
Then I found out about pyenv which is also really nice.
Just need to make sure to read the docs and install the build env at [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment).

Learning about hybrid environments utilizing django as a backend while using js framework as the frontend.
Notable frameworks: React, Svelte, Vue, Htmx, Alpine, Webpack
