I've used vim before back in university for fun. Though it was mostly just traveling around shopping for which editor fit me more. I've tried Vim, Sublime, Atom, Emacs (Evil-mode), VSCode, and even tried coding on Notepad++ because I heard someone did that.

All the editors had their flaws. VScode felt so slow, Sublime was fast but wasn't really extensible enough, Atom looked and felt really nice but felt unstable, Emacs was fun, but I felt like it was crashing more than Atom. Vim i enjoyed the most, but due to some university policies and restrictions, I didn't feel like I could customize it however I wanted since I mostly used the computer lab machines.
