title: Setting up QMK with the planck/ez

I initially found out about the planck/ez when I was browsing the twitch software development category bored one day, and ended up finding [ppy's channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ppy). And when I noticed that he was typing on a small keyboard without using a mouse, it was really fascinating. I have never really thought about my workflow that much in depth before.

Small keyboard, no mouse, and using vim ??? It looked like magic to be honest and it really inspired me to get better at my tools from a vanilla VSCode user. I'll post something us about the types of editors.
