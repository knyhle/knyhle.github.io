title: Setting up QMK with the planck/ez
tags: [blog]

I initially found out about the planck/ez when I was browsing the twitch software development category bored one day, and ended up finding [ppy's channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ppy). And when I noticed that he was typing on a small keyboard without using a mouse, it was really fascinating. I have never really thought about my workflow that much in depth before.

Small keyboard, no mouse, and using vim ??? It looked like magic to be honest and it really inspired me to get better at my tools from a vanilla VSCode user. I'll post something us about the types of editors.

so i looked up the planck, and thought about buying it, but then saw the planck/ez when it. pretty lights and ending snagging one. Though this wasn't my first big keyboard purchase, but this isn't here or there. Not entirely sure why i bought it since i originally hate any keyboard without a number pad.

I originally had a Kinesis Advantage which was really nice. First foray into more custom keyboards, and it was really cool. However, it was really hard to get for my type of hands since my hands are pretty small and it felt kind of uncomfortable.

Thankfully this keyboard was different. No number pad? Ez enough, just program it in yourself. Wont get in too much detail about QMK, but the aspects of layering is really nice. everything is within you home row keys and your hands never even have to leave the keyboard or stretch.

Though, when I bought my keyboard, for some reason I also decided to learn Dvorak. Mostly just from Primeagen really since he uses Dvorak with the Kineses and it inspired to also change my layout. Since it is theoretically more ergonomic. I debated whether to change to dvorak or colemak, but ended up choosing dvorak because it matched more with vim motions hjkl with the movements more separated between each hands and in the "same" general positioning.
